# Dragons of Ballpit

Entry for the Instanssi 2019 demoparty (https://instanssi.org/2019)

Demo coded in Java and Kotlin, using the Processing library.
Requires Oracle Java 8 to be installed.

See the dragons_of_ballpit_5 folder for the submitted entry.
Much of it is last minute panic tuning at the party.

Coding by FractalPixel and Shiera, Music by Irah, Graphics by Shiera and Irah.
Special thanks to Anton for helping with performance tuning the JVM.

Because of Super Advanced Object Backed Balls this uses
gazillions of memories, so giving 8 GB to the JVM is recommended.
This is already done in dragons_of_ballpit.sh, but despite our intensive
Windows testing we did not manage to do that for windows, so only 1 GB
is given to Java in dragons_of_ballpit.bat, if you can, increase that amount
for a satisfactory ball viewing experience.

Greetings to all the cool new and old people we met at Instanssi 2019!
Looking forward to visiting again next year.
