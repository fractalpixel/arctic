# arctic

Working on entry for Instanssi 2019 demoparty.

Demos coded partly in java, using the Processing library.
Some utilities and routines coded in Kotlin (should be callable from java without problems).

## Setting up

Maven project, pom.xml should contain all necessary dependencies.

Main demo in src/main/java/org/digiscapers/arctic/Arctic, run the class.

Bonus demo requires mad scene skills to find.
